        <div><p>Fintecy Ltd ("We") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
            <p>This policy (together with our <a href="/legal/website-terms">Website Terms
                and Conditions</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any
                personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please
                read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data
                and how we will treat it.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the European Union General Data Protection
                Regulation 2016 (the "GDPR"), the data controller is Fintecy Limited.</p>
            <h2>Information We May Collect From You</h2>
            <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site https://fintecy.org and
                    associated application programming interface (collectively, our site). This includes
                    information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service,
                    posting material, requesting further services, and adding/amending information in your
                    account. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site.
                </li>
                <li>If you register for an account with us, we will ask for your first and last name, your email
                    address, a password (to be stored in an encrypted format), and optionally your website
                    address, at the time of registration.
                </li>
                <li>After you register for an account with us, we may also ask for details concerning your
                    business (if you have one), such as your business name and address, VAT Number, and
                    alternative contact details.
                </li>
                <li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. This includes email messages
                    and their attachments, records of phone calls and postal mail that we receive from you.
                </li>
                <li>We may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not
                    have to respond to them.
                </li>
                <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your
                    orders.
                </li>
                <li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location
                    data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing
                    purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.
                </li>
                <li>When you enter payment information, such as your credit card number, these are processed by
                    our payment processor (Stripe or PayPal depending on your choice of payment method) and we
                    do not process or store your full unmasked payment information. We may store and process the
                    first 6 and last 4 digits of your credit card number and its expiry date, the card type and
                    issuer, the cardholder name and address, and/or (in the event of payment via PayPal) your
                    PayPal account email address.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data we collect and process is strictly limited to that which is necessary for us to provide
                our service to you under the lawful bases of consent and/or necessity.</p>
            <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password or access credentials which enable
                you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password
                confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
            <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address,
                operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information
                to our partners, providers or advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing
                actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
            <p>If you register for an account with us, we may use your IP address at the time of registration
                for "geolocation" (meaning that we will infer your likely country of location, based on your IP
                address). Such geolocation is limited to the country level, and is not guaranteed to be
                accurate. We will provide you the opportunity to correct or remove this information if you
                wish.</p>
            <h2>Sensitive Information</h2>
            <p>We do not request or otherwise collect or store any sensitive personal data as defined under the
                GDPR (for example: data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
                philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning
                health, gender or sexual orientation), whether in aggregate or linked to any person or account.
                If we become aware of any such data being stored or processed in our systems, we will take
                reasonable steps to erase it.</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Our website uses specific cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps
                us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to
                improve our site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we
                use them see our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
            <h2>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h2>
            <p>Our entire site is available over secure SSL (HTTPS) connection. Information that you provide to
                us by filling in forms on our site is therefore transferred from your web browser or server
                using SSL encryption.</p>
            <p>When you enter payment information, such as your credit card number, these are processed by our
                payment processor (Stripe or PayPal depending on your choice of payment method). The checkout
                page and/or specific form fields where you enter such information are served directly from their
                secure servers, and we do not process, receive or store your full unmasked payment details.</p>
            <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the
                European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who
                work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the
                fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support
                services. We maintain confidentiality and privacy agreements with any members of staff having
                access to such information to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data protection
                law. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We
                will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy and our codes of practice.</p>
            <p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, including the use of SSL technology,
                we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at
                your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and
                security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
            <h2>Uses Made Of The Information</h2>
            <p>We use information held about you in the following ways, under the lawful bases of consent,
                necessity and/or legal obligation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and
                    for your computer.
                </li>
                <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we
                    feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes and only
                    where provided by us.
                </li>
                <li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
                </li>
                <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do
                    so.
                </li>
                <li>To notify you about your account activity and usage, and about changes to our service, where
                    you have consented to receive such updates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where we permit selected third parties to use your data, such use is strictly limited to that
                which is necessary to enable us to provide our service to you, and for purposes for which you
                have provided your consent. We ensure that these third parties are compliant with the GDPR and
                other relevant data protection law, and that your data is not used or stored by any third party
                for purposes for which you have not consented.</p>
            <p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you with information about goods and
                services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you, and only where these
                are provided by us.</p>
            <p>If you are a new customer, we will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to
                this. If you email us before registering for or using our site, we will respond to you by email,
                only insofar as required to provide you with the information you have asked for. If you then
                decide that you do not wish to use our site or services based on our response to you, please
                inform us of this and we will no longer contact you.</p>
            <p>We will retain information held about you for the duration of your having an account with us (or
                longer, if required by law). When you no longer need your account, you may delete it by visiting
                your Account Dashboard or by emailing us at privacy@fintecy.org and requesting account deletion.
                We will then no longer retain information about you. If your account is inactive for a long
                period of time, we may also erase information held about you as part of routine maintenance and
                data purging practices.</p>
            <p>If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties,
                please untick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data (the
                registration form or forms in your Account Dashboard).</p>
            <h2>Disclosure Of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our
                subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of
                the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any
                    legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Website Use
                    and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fintecy Ltd, our
                    customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
                    organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
                </li>
                <li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
                    personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
                </li>
                <li>If Fintecy Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which
                    case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the event of any such disclosure, we will use our best efforts contact you to notify you of
                such disclosure, and give you the opportunity to exercise your right to erasure.</p>
            <h2>Notification Of Breach</h2>
            <p>While we take great precaution to protect our systems and servers from unauthorised access, and
                carry out regular internal data security audits, there is a risk of malicious activity
                occurring. If we become aware of any potential or actual breach of our systems which may have
                caused exposure of your personal information, we will contact you via the email address you have
                provided to us within 72 hours of such discovery to inform you of the situation.</p>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will
                usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes
                or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can
                exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to
                collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at
                privacy@fintecy.org.</p>
            <h3>Access To Information (Subject Access Requests)</h3>

                Request under the GDPR). You may exercise this right at any time by emailing privacy@fintecy.org
                from the email address associated with your request. If you have an account with us, or we hold
                any personal information pertaining to you, we will provide this in a machine-readable format
                (such as CSV) within 30 days. There is no fee in relation to your request for access.</p>
            <h3>Right To Erasure</h3>
            <p>You have the right to ask us to remove all data and/or personal information we hold about you. We
                will use reasonable endeavours to remove all information from our systems, including backups
                where technically feasible, within 30 days. You can exercise this right at any time by
                contacting us at privacy@fintecy.org. We may retain certain specific information, where required
                by law. There is no fee in relation to your request for erasure.</p>
            <h3>Withdrawal Of Consent</h3>
            <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing and storage at any time,
                including (but not limited to) your consent to be contacted by us. You may exercise this right
                at any time by emailing privacy@fintecy.org or by unticking the relevant box in the registration
                form, and/or forms displayed in your Account Dashboard.</p>
            <h2>Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks,
                advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that
                these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or
                liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to
                these websites.</p>
            <h2>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
