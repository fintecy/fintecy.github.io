            "Site(s)"), when you use the Fintecy mobile app, and/or when you interact with Fintecy online
            advertisements or marketing emails (collectively the "Services"). It explains what these
            technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            <p>In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect personal information, or
                information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. In such
                cases the <a href="/privacy-policy">Fintecy Privacy Policy</a> will
                apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>

            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small files, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded onto your computer or
                mobile device when you visit certain websites. When you return to these websites, or visit other
                websites that use the same cookies, the websites recognize these cookies and your browsing
                device. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other
                websites.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website operator are called "<strong>first party cookies</strong>". Cookies
                set by parties other than the website operator are called "<strong>third party cookies</strong>".
                The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your web browser both when it visits the
                Fintecy website and when it visits certain other websites where the third party’s cookies are
                also present.</p>
            <p>More information on cookies and their use can be found at <a
                    href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a
                    href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
            <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
            <p>When you access our Sites and Services, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your
                computer or other device. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, and inform
                us about which parts of our websites people have visited.</p>
            <p>We use first party and third party cookies to recognize you as a Fintecy customer, customize
                Fintecy Services, content, and advertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to collect
                information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud, and
                promote trust and safety.</p>
            <p>We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use information about your visits
                to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Fintecy. We
                do not control the types of information collected and stored by these third-party cookies. You
                should check the third-party's website for more information on how they use cookies.</p>
            <p>The following are some examples of information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
            <p>We may collect and store details of how you use our Sites and Services. Except in limited
                instances to ensure quality of our Services over the Internet, such information will not be
                associated with your IP address.</p>
            <p>We may collect information such as your language, inferred zip code or area code, unique device
                identifier, referrer URL, location, and time zone so that we can better understand customer
                behavior and improve our Services.</p>
            <p>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our websites and platforms, which is
                used to understand which parts of our Sites and Services are of most interest. This data is
                aggregated, and thus is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Cookie
                Policy and our Global Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2>What Types Of Cookies Do We Use?</h2>
            <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>
            <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
                They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for
                services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.
                These also include cookies we may rely on for fraud prevention. You can set your browser to
                block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>
            <h3>Performance/Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the
                performance of our Sites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and
                see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and
                therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited
                our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>
            <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our Services so we can
                provide relevant content to you. For example, a functionality cookie can remember your
                preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username.</p>
            <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>Fintecy uses third party service providers to display advertising on our Services and serve
                advertising on other third party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests. These
                cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They
                remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other
                organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been to our websites, you may
                see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet. The information collected
                through this process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them to identify
                your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you
                choose to provide these. Such advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable
                law. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less advertising tailored to your
                inferred interests on our Sites and will not receive targeted Fintecy advertisements on third
                party websites.</p>
            <h2>How Long Will Cookies Stay On My Browsing Device?</h2>
            <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a
                "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you close
                your browser. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are
                deleted.</p>
